# Setup a k8s cluster using multipass

This is a very simple toolkit that helps setup a K8s cluster easily (In order to learn some network knowledges about K8s)

+ Easy to use
- Unconfigurable networks
- Very simple templating
- Still need to init and join nodes manually
- No distributed deployment
- Like a minikube, but you'll have "real nodes" to access to. If you got the effort, you can config them for advanced uses

## Prepare

### Install multipass

```bash

$ sudo apt install multipass

```


### Build & render

In order to simplify the configuration, we support configuration
and template rendering

there are pre-build options which are proxies. 

```yaml
http-proxy: "172.16.184.20:1091"
https-proxy: "172.16.184.20:1091"
```

In order to use configuration instead of writing proxies everywhere, use 

```
{{ .HttpProxy }} and {{ .HttpsProxy }}
```

Also be careful when processing data sensitive fields like private key. Using go template might introduce one `newline` to template file, so remember to trim. 

```yaml
privKey: |
    {{ .PrivKey | nindent 6 }}
```
For example this is translated to 

```yaml
privKey: |
# Note there's a newline below, thus the key is incorrect

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    asdasdasdasdasdasd....
```

Instead you do this

```yaml
privKey: |
    {{- PrivKey | nindent 6 }}
```

in your `yaml.tmpl` file, and render it using that simple go program

```bash

$ go build -o main main.go

$ ./main render

```

To get help, of available commands

```bash
# List available commands
$ ./main help

# Get help of sub commands
$ ./main render help

```


### Launch instance

```bash

# -c 2 uses 2 cpus
# -m 2G 2G memory
# -d 20G 20G disk
# -n node01 node named node01
# file path to .img file

$ multipass launch -v -n node01 --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml -c 2 -m 2G -d 20G file:///home/temp/u_20.04.img
```

A better way of launching instance is via cli

```bash

$ ./main deploy --config ./cloud-init.yaml
```

### purge instance

```bash

$ ./purge.sh {instance_name}
```




### Start K8s cluster


```
# We normally don't have enough resource
# for launching cluster so add this 
# flag
# --ignore-preflight-errors=all


# To start a master node, do this on node01
$ kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors=all
```

### Logging

To check the log of multipass,

```bash

journalctl --unit snap.multipass*

```

## Roadmap
- Cli tool for cluster management
  - Cluster deployment
  - Deletion
  - Adding/Removing nodes
  - Deploy kubernetes resources

- Setup flannel network
- Better template engine
