# Setup a k8s cluster using multipass

This is a very simple toolkit that helps setup a K8s cluster easily (In order to learn some network knowledges about K8s)

+ Easy to use
- Unconfigurable networks
- Very simple templating
- Still need to init and join nodes manually
- No distributed deployment
- Like a minikube, but you'll have "real nodes" to access to. If you got the effort, you can config them for advanced uses

## Prepare

### Install multipass

```bash

$ sudo apt install multipass

```


### Build & render

In order to simplify the configuration, we support configuration
and template rendering

there are pre-build options which are proxies. 

```yaml
http-proxy: "172.16.184.20:1091"
https-proxy: "172.16.184.20:1091"
```

In order to use configuration instead of writing proxies everywhere, use 

```
{{ .HttpProxy }} and {{ .HttpsProxy }}
```

in your `yaml.tmpl` file, and render it using that simple go program

```bash

$ go build -o main main.go

$ ./main

```


### Launch instance

```bash

# -c 2 uses 2 cpus
# -m 2G 2G memory
# -d 20G 20G disk
# -n node01 node named node01
# file path to .img file

$ multipass launch -v -n node01 --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml -c 2 -m 2G -d 20G file://{path_to_image}
```

### purge instance

```bash

$ ./purge.sh {instance_name}
```




### Start K8s cluster


```
# We normally don't have enough resource
# for launching cluster so add this 
# flag
# --ignore-preflight-errors=all


# To start a master node, do this on node01
$ kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors=all
```
